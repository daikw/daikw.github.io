Profile:
  I'm a software engineer based in Tokyo with 5+ years of experience in the software industry.
  My focus area for the first few years in my experience was web applications,
  although I've been keeping a full-stack perspective by working on DevOps with embedded engineering team.
  I like open-minded and scientific discussions, and I really love to develop software & collaborate with teammates.

Experience:
  - Employer: Photosynth. Inc.
    Place: Tamachi, Tokyo
    Positions:
      - Title: Embedded & DevOps Engineer
        Date: Nov 2020 - Present
        Details:
          - Responsible for developing gateways for IoT services (Akerun).
          - Eliminated development bottlenecks by incorporating web development processes, and reduced the firmware lead time to less than half.
          - Setup & maintain CI/CD with self-hosted gitlab server & hardware computes, and accelerated teammates' development.
        Badges: [Gitlab, Zephyr, Node, C, Docker, Raspberry-Pi, Arduino, nRF52]
      - Title: Embedded Engineer
        Date: Apr 2023 - Jun 2023
        Details:
          - Responsible for researching what kind of IoT devices are suitable and feasible to develop.
          - Researched and evaluated some modern IoT technologies.
          - Developed some prototypes of a new IoT device with modern technologies, like nRF52, ESP32, and so on.
        Badges: [Gitlab, Zephyr, Node, C, Docker, Raspberry-Pi, Arduino, nRF52]
      - Title: Development leader
        Date: Oct 2022 - Mar 2023
        Details:
          - I took leadership of the development team for the new IoT service project, which is already behind schedule.
          - There are few engineers who have enough experiences, so I have to lead the team with a full-stack perspective.
          - By adopting servant leadership style, we organized non-development factors that had become bottlenecks and led the team to a quantitative goal with DevOps in mind.
